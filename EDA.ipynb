    "- The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This dataset is a subset of the larger report, which includes data from various sources such as the Gallup World Poll and other national surveys. The data was extracted from the World Happiness Report and made available for public use. However, the original data was collected by various researchers and organizations as part of their ongoing efforts to measure and understand happiness and well-being around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We use observed data on the six variables and estimates of their associations with life evaluations to explain the variation across countries. They include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. Our happiness rankings are not based on any index of these six factors – the scores are instead based on individuals’ own assessments of their lives, in particular, their answers to the single-item Cantril ladder life-evaluation question, much as epidemiologists estimate the extent to which life expectancy is affected by factors such as smoking, exercise, and diet"

    "Detailed information about each of the Predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log GDP per capita** is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to a constant 2017 international dollars, taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) by the World Bank (version 17, metadata last updated on January 22, 2023). See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details. GDP data for 2022 are not yet available, so we extend the GDP time series from 2021 to 2022 using country-specific forecasts of real GDP growth from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 112 (November 2022) or, if missing, from the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects (last updated: January 10, 2023), after adjustment for population growth. The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita, as this form fits the data significantly better than GDP per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The time series for **Healthy life expectancy at birth** is constructed based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository, with data available for 2005, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2019. To match this report’s sample period (2005-2022), interpolation and extrapolation are used. See Statistical Appendix 1 for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Social support** (0-1) is the national average of the binary responses (0=no, 1=yes) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Freedom to make life choices** (0-1) is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generosity** is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the donation question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on log GDP per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Perceptions of corruption** (0-1) are the average of binary answers to two GWP questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” Where data for government corruption are missing, the perception of business corruption is used as the overall corruption perception measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Positive affect** is defined as the average of previous-day effects measures for laughter, enjoyment, and interest. The inclusion of interest (first added for World Happiness Report 2022), gives us three components in each of positive and negative affect, and slightly improves the equation fit in column 4. The general form for the affect questions is: Did you experience the following feelings during a lot of the day yesterday?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Negative affect** is defined as the average of previous-day effects measures for worry, sadness, and anger.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Life ladder**: Life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings. They are based on answers to the main life evaluation question. The Cantril ladder asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the **best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0**. They are then asked to rate their own current lives **on a 0 to 10 scale**. The rankings are from nationally representative samples over three years.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Confidence in National Government**: The \"Confidence in National Government\" variable in the World Happiness Report is calculated based on the following question asked in the Gallup World Poll:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Do you have confidence in the national government?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Respondents are given the following options to choose from:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Yes, always\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"Yes, sometimes\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"No, rarely\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"No, never\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Don't know\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **The variable is calculated as the percentage of respondents who answer \"Yes, always\" or \"Yes, sometimes\" to this question.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This variable is one of several social factors that are included in the calculation of the World Happiness Report's overall happiness score for each country. The report combines data on social factors such as income, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption to arrive at a comprehensive measure of happiness."
